# The Importance of Functions in Programming Languages: A Fundamental Yet Overlooked Aspect

💡 **Have you ever considered that, regardless of the programming language you choose, functions are something no one can do without?** 

They are the foundation of every language, essential for keeping code clear and providing the simplest form of code reuse.
However, despite their importance, functions are often treated with little care — given confusing names, and sometimes becoming excessively large. 
And what about their structure? Often horrendous.

Yet, when written with attention, functions can reduce complexity and improve code readability. On the other hand, poorly written functions — even just a few lines — can make the code unreadable and hard to maintain.

Let's look at an example:

```csharp
public Reward GetLevelReward(Player player, Level level)
{
    if (player == null || level == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(player == null ? nameof(player) : nameof(level));
    }

    return level.Difficulty switch
    {
        Difficulty.EASY => CalculateEasyReward(player, level),
        Difficulty.MEDIUM => CalculateMediumReward(player, level),
        Difficulty.HARD => CalculateHardReward(player, level),
        _ => throw new InvalidLevelDifficultyException(level.Difficulty)
    };
}
```

⚠️ This function, despite being concise, violates several principles:

1. It tends to grow: It will grow as new difficulty levels are added, making it less maintainable.
2. Single Responsibility Principle: It handles multiple responsibilities — calculating rewards and validating inputs.
3. Open/Closed Principle: This function has to change every time a new difficulty level is added, which makes it less extensible.

So, what can we do to write better functions? Here are a few essential tips:

  - 📛 Use Descriptive Names: It may seem obvious, but this is often neglected. A good function name clearly conveys what it does.
  - ✂️ Limit Parameters: Too many parameters complicate the function itself and make testing more difficult.
  - 🚫 Avoid Boolean Parameters: If a function needs a boolean flag, it's a sign that it's doing more than one thing.

🛠️ By following these simple principles, you'll improve code readability, reduce complexity, and make your projects more maintainable. 

Let's not overlook the importance of well-designed functions!
