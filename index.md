The passion for my work leads me to learn new techniques and to integrate easily with any team.
Over the years I have had the opportunity to work in many important projects (both desktop and cloud) in which I have always paid particular attention to the quality and performance of the code.

I learned the techniques of CI / CD; monitoring has become for me an indispensable tool thanks to which I can react proactively to any bugs / problems present in production.

I had the opportunity to fill the role of DevOps during which I learned the use of Terraform as infrastructure as code, Kubernetes as container orchestrator and Helm as package manager for Kubernetes.

As a DevOps, one of the objectives achieved was the reduction of infrastructure costs through automatic in/out scaling techniques.

Currently, I'm a senior software Engineer in Frontiers.
